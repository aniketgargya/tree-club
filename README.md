Buit with Bootstrap, Next.js, Imgur API, Apollo, and MongoDB.

## Description
A web app I created that allows the site owner to create markdown posts and upload images via the Imgur API. These posts can be viewed on the home page.

## Setup
To run this, download the repo and do the following.

- Create an Imgur Application at https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient.

- Copy the client id.

- Install dependences:
```bash
npm install
```

- Create a ```.env``` file:
```bash
touch .env # on mac and linux
```

- Put your Imgur client id, graphql url, node environment, and mongo uri in the file like so:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
NODE_ENV=development
IMGUR_CLIENT_ID=1234567890
GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000/graphql
```

- Start in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

- Start in production mode:
```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```
